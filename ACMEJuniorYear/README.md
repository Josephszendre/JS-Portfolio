These are the most notable algorithms and programs that I've built my junior year in the ACME program through February 2017.

The code requires Python 2.7 to be installed with various scientific and numerical libraries installed. Although not all necessary packages come standard, Anaconda is recommended; however pip (pip install pckg_name) can also install all or any additional libraries needed.

As of right now only the Donald Trump Sentence Generator (spec file under markov_chains) has sample output.

All source code files are either .py or .ipynb (only 1), all other files .pyc, .npz, .png are data files.

The specifications for these labs can be found at acme.byu.edu.

Note that Python is a weakly typed language with extensive operator overloading, which can make code difficult to understand. These weren't graded for readability so I've tried to add additional comments.
