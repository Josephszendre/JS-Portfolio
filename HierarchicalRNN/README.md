This is an implementation of "A Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder For Generative Context-Aware Query Suggestion" (Sordoni et al., 2015, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02221.pdf)

This paper extends the encoder-decoder architecture used in neural machine translation systemsto generatively model conversations. Once trained this architecture can generate novel conversations that never existed in the dataset.

This work was done while participating in the Amazon Alexa Prize Competition (alexaprize.developer.amazon.com). Ultimately we decided against using this model for natural language generation.
