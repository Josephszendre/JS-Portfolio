ACMEJuniorYear: A colletion of labs that I completed for ACME Fall 2016 and Winter 2018

Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine: I developed this on my own for CS 678 but it has been done before.

Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder Decoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02221): Implemented this for the amazon alexa prize competition, this is the only PyTorch implementation of it that I know of.
