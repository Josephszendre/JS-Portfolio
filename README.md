Portfolio for Joseph Szendre (BS 2018, BYU, Applied Computational Mathematics)

As a computational mathematics major with emphases in computer science and computational chemical engineering I had many opportunities to code up the algorithms and concepts taught in class. During the last year of my undergraduate education I specialized in Deep Learning by helping develop the curriculum for the graduate computer science course CS 501 Introduction to Deep Learning and participating in the exclusive Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge (February - August 2018).

This portfolio showcases my competency in deep learning, both in TensorFlow and PyTorch, software engineering, applied mathematical modelling (dynamical systems and PDEs) and probabalistic modelling.

All of the code presented here was completed in a computer science research lab or in the following mathematics and computer science courses.

Computer Science Coursework (4 credits undergraduate, 9 credits graduate coursework) 
CS 240, Advanced Programming Concepts
CS 501, Introduction to Deep Learning
CS 678, Advanced Neural Networks.
CS 697, Graduate Projects

Computational Mathematics Courses (32 credits)

Math 320-323 Algorithm Design & Opt 1, 2 (8 credits)
Math 344-347 Mathematical Analysis 1, 2 (8 credits)

Math 404-407 Model Uncertainty & Data 1, 2 (8 credits)
Math 438-441 Model Dynamics & Control 1, 2 (8 credits)

For this major I completed 2 lab assignments per week implementing in code what we would learnin class. They are accessible here: http://www.acme.byu.edu/2017-2018-materials/

ComputationalScienceCoursework: A few of the python labs that I completed while in the Applied Computational Math program. These were chosen for theirfi

ConvolutionalDeepBeliefNetwork: This is a model that I derived independently and implemented for CS 678, Advanced Neural Networks.
