# Portfolio - Joseph Szendre
These are the most notable algorithms and programs that I've built through February 2017 in the Applied Mathematics and Computation degree at Brigham Young University

The code requires Python 2.7 to be installed with various scientific data science libraries installed. A data science package manager like Anaconda would install most of the needed libraries. Any others can be installed with pip or conda (if installed).

The specifications for these labs can be found at acme.byu.edu

Note that Python is a weakly typed language with extensive operator overloading. If any section of code is confusing reading the specifications document may help.
